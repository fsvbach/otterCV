Dear Sir or Madam,\\

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Warehouse position at River Tech, the leading supplier in plumbing supplies. As an experienced warehouse worker, I am confident that River Tech is an excellent place for me to utilize my skills. \\

During my previous role in a warehouse position at Crane \& Jenkins, my responsibilities included shipping and receiving products, preparing orders, sorting, placing, and organizing items, taking inventory, and upholding all safety standards. Safety has always been one of my biggest priorities in the workplace and in my personal life, as my father was paralyzed in a warehouse accident when I was a child.\\

Thank you for your consideration of me as a candidate for the Warehouse position at River Tech. I look forward to hearing more about the company and the expectations of the Warehouse position.\\

Sincerely,
