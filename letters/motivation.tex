I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Warehouse position at River Tech, the leading supplier in plumbing supplies. As an experienced warehouse worker, I am confident that River Tech is an excellent place for me to utilize my skills. \\

During my previous role in a warehouse position at Crane \& Jenkins, my responsibilities included shipping and receiving products, preparing orders, sorting, placing, and organizing items, taking inventory, and upholding all safety standards. Safety has always been one of my biggest priorities in the workplace and in my personal life, as my father was paralyzed in a warehouse accident when I was a child. I am meticulous, and I take the time to finish the job correctly. Over the course of my professional experience I became more efficient, and I can now complete detail-oriented tasks correctly and in a short period of time.\\

My professional skills expand beyond my warehouse operation abilities. I also possess valuable attributes such as stellar communication, dependability, punctuality, and professionalism. I have adequate knowledge of data entry and equipment repair. I also have exceptional vision and have made it a priority to stay physically fit, as this career path requires a lot of heavy lifting, pushing, and pulling.\\

Thank you for your consideration of me as a candidate for the Warehouse position at River Tech. I look forward to hearing more about the company and the expectations of the Warehouse position.\\
